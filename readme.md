# miniplate

### Why
Most of the time the boilerplate generators out there are too big.
When hacking around simple projects, I'd like to keep my app very small.
Miniplate is an attempt to curate a set of commonly used framework and lib combo's

### Usage
```bash
npx miniplate next-tailwind 
```

### Miniplates
* next-tailwind - NextJS and Tailwind
